- Class: text
  Output: Did it work?

- Class: text
  Output: Alright. Let's start with our most simple task. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Try create an object "Pikachu" by typing "Pikachu <- 2 + 2"into the console.
  CorrectAnswer: Pikachu <- 2 + 2
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Pikachu <- 2 + 2');expr_creates_var('Pikachu')
  Hint: Type Pikachu <- 2 + 2. If its still too hard for you, you may type "skip()" into your console. 

- Class: text
  Output: Cool. You've learned how to create an object! If you look at your top-right corner (your environment window to be more precise), you'll notice an object named "Pikachu" in it. This Pokemon will be crucial to your next question.

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Let's try naming a Pokemon. Type "Pikachu" into the console again. Remember, you must have him created as an object to pass this question. Otherwise, you'll get an error message and I'll make fun of you through the hint pop-up message.
  CorrectAnswer: Pikachu
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctExpr='Pikachu')
  Hint: Pikapika. You suck. You probably got an error:object "Pikachu" not found. To solve this, simply create an object "Pikachu" by typing "Pikachu <- 2+2". If its still too hard for you, you may type "skip()" into your console. 

- Class: text
  Output: Awesome work. Now we'll try the next question. 

- Class: cmd_question
  Output: Again, this is a cmd_question. Usually, you will have to type in exactly what the author (me) wanted in the console to pass this question. However, this time it'll be a little different. Type in any expression that equals to 4. Example:"2 + 2" or "sqrt(16)".
  CorrectAnswer: 4
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= 4)
  Hint: Any expression should work as long as it equals to 4! Dont just type "4" into it, though. It'll work, but please don't.

- Class: text
  Output: Excellent job. Now we're moving to multiple choice question.
  
- Class: text
  Output: By the way, did you noticed that if you entered "Pikachu" for the previous question, you could've also answered the previous question?
  
  
- Class: mult_question
  Output: What's 5 times 5?
  AnswerChoices: 25;40;6
  CorrectAnswer: 25
  AnswerTests: omnitest(correctVal= '25')
  Hint: It's 25. God damn it! Do you even watch Rick and Morty?

  Output: Great work. That concludes the test run of this lesson. Hopefully we are able to load this lesson again.
